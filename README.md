# Weather Forecast Dashboard

## Description

The user is presented with a search bar to enter a city name, and once the search button is clicked they will be prompted to enter a state name. The previously empty containers below will then present data for the current weather, as well as a five-day forecast for that city. Each time a new city is searched, the previous data should disappear, but remain in the local storage.
